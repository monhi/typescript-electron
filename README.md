# Typescript Electron 


This is a simple Electron application based on typescipt.
I need it to be a boilerplate for other typescript and electron based project.

Now I can develop electron projects based on typescipt language and have better control over it.



Source code of typescript files are in `./ts` folder.
Contents will be copied to ./dist folder after compilation.

I use webview tag to show web links.


# How to run the project
* Run `npm install` to install necessary packages.
* Run `npm run build` to compile the ts files into js files and also uglify the js contents.
* Run `npm run start` to run the project.


# Main link
I use the following link to create this project:

I add html page from following project to it:
